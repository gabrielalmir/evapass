# EvaPass - Password Manager CLI

Welcome to the **Password Manager CLI**! ðŸŽ‰

This project is designed to help you improve your coding skills and learn more about working together as a team. The goal is to build a basic Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that manages passwords securely.

## Overview

The **Password Manager** is a CLI application where users can:

- **Create** new password entries.
- **Read** stored passwords.
- **Update** existing passwords.
- **Delete** passwords.

**Bonus Features**:
- Implement a **master key** to secure access to all accounts.
- **Encrypt** passwords to ensure data security.

## Requirements

- You can use any programming language you are comfortable with or wish to learn.
- The application should be able to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for storing passwords associated with different accounts.
- Passwords should be stored securely, preferably encrypted.
- Users should be able to access their accounts by entering a master key (optional, but highly encouraged).

## Features

1. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - The application should have a user-friendly CLI for managing passwords.
   - Commands should include options for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting passwords.

2. **Master Key**:
   - Secure the application with a master key that users must enter to access their stored passwords.
   - The master key should be stored securely.

3. **Password Encryption**:
   - Passwords should be encrypted before storing them.
   - Ensure that decryption is only possible when the correct master key is provided.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement proper error handling to manage invalid inputs, incorrect master key entries, etc.

5. **Documentation**:
   - Provide clear documentation on how to set up and use the CLI application.
